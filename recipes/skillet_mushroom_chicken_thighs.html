            <li>Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and 
                cook until golden brown and cooked through, reaching an internal 
                temperature of 165 degrees F, about 4-5 minutes per side; set aside. 
                Reduce heat to medium low.</li>

            <li>Gradually whisk in chicken stock and thyme. Bring to a boil; reduce 
                heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced and slightly

                pepper, to taste. Return chicken to the skillet.</li>
